A starter HTML5+CSS3 website project with a collapsible responsive side menu and a flex grid.

## What is a starter project?

A starter project is a project with the basic file structure and some components readily integrated. They are great for starting your own website.

## What's inside 'flex grid'?

This starter project comes with a menu that adequates itself to the screen width of the device in which the website was opened.

- in large devices (>500px) the navigation menu is displayed in the top of the page
- in smaller devices (<=500px) the menu is hidden by default and can be opened by clicking on a menu button on the top left of the page

Furthermore, it includes a flex grid of elements that makes content dinamically fluid acording to screen size of device.
